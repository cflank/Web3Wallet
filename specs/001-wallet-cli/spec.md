# Feature Specification: Web3 Wallet CLI Tool

**Feature Branch**: `001-wallet-cli`
**Created**: 2025-01-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "ÊûÑÂª∫‰∏Ä‰∏™‰∏ì‰∏öÁ∫ßÁöÑ Web3 Èí±ÂåÖÂú∞ÂùÄÁîüÊàê‰∏éÁÆ°ÁêÜÂëΩ‰ª§Ë°åÂ∑•ÂÖ∑"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A Web3 developer needs a secure, professional-grade command-line tool to generate, import, store, and manage Ethereum wallet addresses with hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet support. The tool must ensure cryptographic security while providing an intuitive CLI interface compatible with existing wallet standards.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am a new user, **When** I run `wallet create --words 24 --save mykey`, **Then** I receive a 24-word BIP39 mnemonic, corresponding Ethereum address, and encrypted keystore file

2. **Given** I have an existing MetaMask mnemonic, **When** I run `wallet import --mnemonic "word1 word2..." --save imported`, **Then** the generated address matches my MetaMask wallet address

3. **Given** I have a saved encrypted wallet file, **When** I run `wallet load mykey.json --address-only`, **Then** I see the wallet address without needing to decrypt the private key

4. **Given** I want to derive additional addresses, **When** I run `wallet derive m/44'/60'/0'/0/5 --from-file mykey.json`, **Then** I receive the 6th address in the HD wallet sequence

5. **Given** I have multiple saved wallets, **When** I run `wallet list`, **Then** I see all wallet files with their aliases and addresses

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an invalid mnemonic is provided during import?
- How does the system handle corrupted encrypted wallet files?
- What occurs when insufficient entropy is available for secure random generation?
- How does the tool respond to incorrect passwords during wallet loading?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST generate cryptographically secure BIP39 mnemonics of 12 or 24 words
- **FR-002**: System MUST derive Ethereum addresses using standard HD path m/44'/60'/0'/0/x
- **FR-003**: System MUST encrypt private keys and mnemonics using PBKDF2 + AES-256-GCM
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to import wallets via mnemonic phrase or private key
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to save encrypted wallets to named JSON files
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to load wallets and view addresses without full decryption
- **FR-007**: System MUST support HD wallet address derivation from custom paths
- **FR-008**: System MUST list all locally stored wallet files with metadata
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate mnemonic phrase correctness before processing
- **FR-010**: System MUST clear sensitive data from memory after use
- **FR-011**: System MUST hide password input during entry
- **FR-012**: System MUST respond to all commands within 1 second
- **FR-013**: Generated addresses MUST be compatible with MetaMask and standard wallets
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide detailed error messages for invalid operations
- **FR-015**: System MUST support both JSON and human-readable output formats

### Key Entities

- **Wallet**: Contains mnemonic phrase, master private key, and derived addresses with encryption metadata
- **Keystore**: Encrypted storage format containing wallet data, salt, and encryption parameters
- **Address**: Ethereum address derived from HD path with corresponding private key
- **Command**: CLI operation with parameters, validation rules, and output format requirements
