## Core Principles

### I. Security-First Development
All cryptographic operations MUST use industry-standard algorithms and libraries. Private keys and mnemonics MUST be encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage. Seed generation MUST follow BIP39 standard with cryptographically secure random number generators. Memory containing sensitive data MUST be zeroed after use.

*Rationale: Cryptocurrency wallets handle high-value assets where security vulnerabilities can result in permanent financial loss.*

### II. Error Handling Excellence
All functions MUST return Result<T, E> or Option<T> types. Every possible error condition MUST be explicitly handled. User-facing errors MUST provide clear, actionable messages without exposing internal system details. Panic conditions are prohibited in production code paths.

*Rationale: Rust's type system enables compile-time error handling verification, preventing runtime failures that could compromise user funds.*

### III. Performance & Memory Safety
Code MUST leverage Rust's zero-cost abstractions and ownership system. Async operations MUST use tokio runtime efficiently. Memory allocations should be minimized for hot paths. All blockchain operations MUST complete within 30 seconds with proper timeout handling.

*Rationale: CLI tools require responsive interaction while maintaining memory safety guarantees that prevent buffer overflows and memory corruption.*

### IV. User Experience & CLI Design
CLI interface MUST be intuitive with clear subcommands and help text. All operations requiring user confirmation MUST display transaction details before execution. Progress indicators MUST be shown for long-running operations. Input validation MUST occur before any processing begins.

*Rationale: Complex cryptographic operations must be accessible to users while preventing accidental loss of funds through unclear interfaces.*

### V. Dependency Management
Core dependencies MUST be actively maintained with security audit history. Cryptographic libraries MUST NOT be implemented in-house. Version pinning MUST be used for all security-critical dependencies. Dependency updates MUST include security impact assessment.

*Rationale: Cryptocurrency software inherits security properties from its entire dependency tree, making careful dependency management essential.*

## Technical Constraints

**Language/Runtime**: Rust 2021 Edition with stable toolchain
**Core Dependencies**: ethers-rs (blockchain), bip39 (mnemonics), clap (CLI), aes-gcm (encryption), tokio (async)
**Cryptographic Standards**: BIP39 (mnemonics), BIP44 (HD wallets), AES-256-GCM (encryption)
**Supported Networks**: Ethereum mainnet, testnets, and EVM-compatible chains
**Storage Format**: Encrypted JSON keystore files compatible with standard wallet formats
**Performance Targets**: Command response time <1s, memory usage <50MB baseline

## Quality Assurance Standards

**Testing Requirements**:
- Unit test coverage MUST exceed 80%
- Integration tests MUST cover all CLI commands and error paths
- Security tests MUST validate encryption/decryption roundtrips
- Property-based tests MUST verify cryptographic operations

**Code Quality Tools**:
- rustfmt MUST be used for consistent formatting
- clippy MUST pass with no warnings
- Documentation MUST cover all public APIs with examples
- Security audit MUST be performed before any release

**Compliance Standards**:
- Follow Rust API Guidelines for naming and design patterns
- Adhere to OWASP cryptographic storage guidelines
- Implement proper key derivation following PBKDF2 or Argon2 standards

## Governance

Constitution amendments require documentation of security impact, compatibility with existing keystores, and migration plan for breaking changes. All code reviews MUST verify compliance with security and error handling principles. Performance regressions MUST be justified with security or maintainability benefits.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-01-21 | **Last Amended**: 2025-01-21
